                                        In my capacity as front end developer 
                                        on the Pimp My Cause project I 
                                        built the front page according to specification while also adapting 
                                        the design for responsive behaviour. The technologies I used were 
                                        Zurb Foundation framework, HTML5, CSS3, Sass and Grunt to run tasks.

                                        I worked within a team of women to produce a total solution for the 
                                        client with regular client meetings. The project was managed using JIRA 
                                        and a SCRUM approach with weekly stand ups. The demands and work practices 
                                        comparable to any such industry based project provided me with real 
                                        world experience as a Front End Developer.

                                        My involvement in the Foof Records website was the design and layout of
                                        the site along with development of the static site. I 
                                        am currently building a WordPress site to support this custom theme. The 
                                        technologies I used for design were Illustrator/Photoshop and for
                                        frontend build a proprietary framework called Matter along with HTML5, CSS3, LESS and Grunt.

                                        out their requirements and preferred style of website. Meeting and liaising
                                        throughout the process and then providing post care support.

                            This site also provides a blogging platform along with 
                            social media sharing.

                                        The Crooked website will require much the same technologies and approach 
                                        as this personal website has taken to build. The project scaffolding will
                                        be the same using Bower to install frontend tools like Bootstrap and Font 
                                        Awesome. The Sass preprocessor will be used and Gulp for task automation.
                                        The static site will be built according to the PSD design and will then
                                        be used to built a WordPress site.

                                        that will create transferrable skills for other such sites.

                        When I commence a new project I use a template that I devised containing industry
                        tools and a directory structure useful for an expedient build. The project startup 
                        includes the Bootstrap v4 framework, Font Awesome, the Sass preprocessor and 
                        Gulp task manager. Upon cloning this project to be used as a starting point dependencies 
                        are pulled using the package managers npm and Bower.

                        <p>
                        I have designed and developed a few websites honing my frontend skills in HTML5, CSS3, 
                        JavaScript and jQuery. I am looking forward to building on my WordPress skills and plan 
                        to put my existing static sites into WordPress while improving my PHP programming
                        skills in the process.

                        <p>
                            I worked as a backend developer for many years prior to a change of career
                            into education for a couple of years teaching at both college and university
                            level. I have since chosen to return to industry exploring a new direction
                            into frontend development. I enjoy the creative process of building websites and 
                            would very much like to pursue this employment interest. 
                        </p>

                            I enjoy an outdoors lifestyle of exercise on the beach with weekends of kayaking
                            and surfing and holidays off snowboarding. The rest of the time I spend 
                            in front of the computer researching or building websites like this one.
